Abstract: Traditional chemotherapy is often temporarily effective due to the strength of the drugs used, then extremely toxic to the individual due to the mechanism by which the drug works. Many of these drugs, such as gemcitabine, tend to be highly toxic, have poor bioavailability, and have a low therapeutic index. Additionally, recent discoveries in the potential for vascular disrupting agents have been seen as a possible indirect method to cancer treatment. This paper reports the use of a polymersome based system to deliver both an anticancer agent, gemcitabine, and a vascular disrupting agent, combretastatin A-4, to Ovcar-5 cancer cells and HUVEC cells in vitro. We show that gemcitabine can be actively loaded with 90% loading efficiency and combretastatin can be loaded with 20% efficiency. An XTT assay was performed by treating Ovcar-5 cells, HUVEC cells, and a co-culture of both cell lines with various concentrations of free gemcitabine, free combretastatin A-4, and drug encapsulated polymersomes. We show that the use of gemcitabine and combretastatin A-4 encapsulated polymersomes are more efficient at killing and preventing the growth of both cell lines than each free drug independently, thus assessing the idea of “synergy”. These studies suggest that polymersome-based drug formulations of both a hydrophilic and hydrophobic drug could be useful for the in vivo treatment of ovarian cancer due to the controlled toxicity and implementation of synergy.
