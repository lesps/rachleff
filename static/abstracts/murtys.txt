Abstract: Successful treatment of brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is limited by the cumulative dose of radiation therapy (RT) that can be safely given and the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the delivery of systemic anticancer agents into tumor tissue. Consequently, the overall prognosis remains grim. We describe here pilot studies in cell culture experiments and an animal model of GBM in which RT is complemented by PEGylated-gold nanoparticles (GNPs). GNPs markedly increased cellular DNA damage inflicted by ionizing radiation in human GBM-derived cell lines, and resulted in significantly reduced clonogenic survival (with dose-enhancement ratio of ~1.3). Intriguingly, combining RT with GNPs also resulted in markedly increased DNA damage to brain blood vessels. Follow-up in vitro experiments confirmed that the combination of GNPs and RT resulted in considerably increased DNA damage in brainderived endothelial cells. Finally, the combination of GNPs and RT resulted in increased survival of mice with orthotopic GBM tumors. Prior treatment of mice with brain tumors led to increased extravasation and in-tumor deposition of GNPs, suggesting that RT-induced BBB abrogation can further improve the tumor-tissue targeting of GNPs and thus further optimize the radiosensitization of brain tumors by GNPs. Taken together, these results suggest that GNPs may be usefully integrated into targeted radiation treatment of brain tumors, with potential benefits resulting from increased tumor cell radiosensitization to selective effects on umorassociated vasculature.
