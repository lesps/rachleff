Abstract: This paper takes the assignment problem and adds an additional factor: obstacle avoidance. The inclusion of obstacle avoidance in the assignment problem is an important step in real-world application of assignment and task allocation In this paper we have addressed: the determination of the shortest-distance path around an obstacle, representing the set of possible paths as a graph search with the Hungarian algorithm, performing a graph search problem and implementing Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and developing a simulation of flying robots to test the accuracy of our solution.
