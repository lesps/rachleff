Abstract: Effective Bragg stacks are formed with alternating layers of high- and low-index films. While titania and silica nanoparticles have traditionally formed the high- and low-index films, respectively, future electrical applications may benefit from Bragg stacks fabricated solely from titania. In this study, low-index titania films are generated through control of the film’s porosity. Micelles of triblock copolymers, poly(ethylene oxide-b-propylene oxide-bethylene oxide) (PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO), formed in water are spin coated with aqueous dispersions of titania nanoparticles. Removal of the copolymer micelles yields films with lower refractive indexes. These low-index titania films can be coupled with standard high-index titania films to create pure titania Bragg stacks that reflect light at a certain wavelength. A MATLAB program is used to precisely calculate such parameters as film thickness, refractive index contrast, and the number of layers necessary for the desired reflectance at a specific wavelength. As a Bragg mirror enhancement for dye-sensitized solar cells, titania Bragg stacks can improve the solar cell’s photonto-electron conversion while preventing the inhibition of electron flow through the solar cell normally caused by silica films.
